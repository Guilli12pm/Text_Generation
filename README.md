# Text_Generation

This code is used to generate text given an input corpus, using Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Methods.

QML is based on Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQC) with multiple angle parameters that will be trained to obtain a specific measurement for a quantum circuit. 

The specific QML method used in this project is the Quantum Recurrent Neural Network. 

To generate text, there are three methods available:

1) Free Fermionic Quantum circuits: A classically simulable quantum method using matchgates.
2) Fully Quantum Circuit: a generic quantum circuit.
3) Classical Circuit: a generic classical RNN

For each, the number of layers and the hidden size/number of qubits can be changed.

Requirements for this project are in the **requirements.txt** file.

Run with **python3.11**
